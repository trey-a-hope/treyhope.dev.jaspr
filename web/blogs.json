[{"author":"Trey Hope","category":"coffee-code","content":"![1000153524.jpg](/blogs/2025-12-27-coffee-code-jaspr-web-framework/1.jpg)\n\n> Café Bombón from [Naturalia Café](https://naturaliacafe-fkc32fw.gamma.site/) in Laureles, Medellín\n> \n\nI still remember the first web project I made in college: a website about my favorite X-Men character, Wolverine.\n\nThe site was quite basic and rough around the edges, but I loved being able to create something for the web that was flexible and expressed my ideas.\n\nHowever, I found the actual development process—working directly with **HTML** and **CSS**—to be somewhat cumbersome.\n\nI haven't dabbled much in web development since mobile development—especially Flutter—sparked my interest.\n\n![ScrollCapture 2025-12-27 at 10.40.44.gif](/blogs/2025-12-27-coffee-code-jaspr-web-framework/3.gif)\n\n> Jaspr website.\n> \n\nLuckily, that's where the beauty of [Jaspr](https://jaspr.site/) comes in; it addresses some of the challenges with web development and offers a better experience for developers.\n\nIt's built using **Dart** and has a very similar feel to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), even though it targets an entirely different platform.\n\nIn fact, you don't use any Flutter in a Jaspr app at all (unless you plan to embed some widgets).\n\nIn Jaspr, the concept of **Components** is inspired by the concept of **Widgets** in Flutter.\n\n```dart\n// A stateless component that renders a Bulma CSS hero section\nclass BulmaHero extends StatelessComponent {\n  final String title;\n  final String subtitle;\n\n  const BulmaHero({\n    required this.title,\n    required this.subtitle,\n    super.key,\n  });\n\n  @override\n  Component build(BuildContext context) {\n    // Create a small, centered container with Bulma's hero styling\n    return section(\n      id: 'bulma-hero',\n      classes: 'container is-small is-max-desktop section hero is-link',\n      [\n        // Center-aligned hero content\n        div(classes: 'hero-body has-text-centered', [\n          // Main title\n          p(classes: 'title', [\n            .text(title),\n          ]),\n          // Subtitle text\n          p(classes: 'subtitle', [\n            .text(subtitle),\n          ]),\n        ]),\n      ],\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOver the Christmas break, I've been using Jaspr to rebuild my original website (which was built using [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/web)) to feel like a true website rather than a web app.\n\nThe cool part is it looks like a normal widget, but it actually gets compiled into valid HTML and CSS for the web.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-12-27 at 10.46.39 AM.png](/blogs/2025-12-27-coffee-code-jaspr-web-framework/2.png)\n\n> The **BulmaHero** component as valid HTML.\n> \n\nSince it's a web framework, it uses CSS, which means I can easily integrate a CSS framework like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and build my own components from there.\n\n![ScrollCapture 2025-12-27 at 10.59.23.gif](/blogs/2025-12-27-coffee-code-jaspr-web-framework/4.gif)\n\n> Bulma site.\n> \n\nJaspr offers several advantages that I've noticed:\n\n- *Improved SEO (search engines can better index the content)*\n- *Better routing architecture (supports both single-page and multi-page routing using a server/client approach)*\n- *Faster load times (the app is significantly lighter than a typical Flutter web app)*\n\nIf you're looking to learn a new framework, enjoy web development but prefer alternatives to conventional methods, or simply have been exposed to Flutter in some way, I highly recommend checking it out.\n\nMajor kudos to the creators of both projects: [Kilian Schulte](https://x.com/schultek_dev) for Jaspr and [Jeremy Thomas](https://x.com/jgthms) for Bulma. Stay tuned for further progress.","date":"2025-12-27T00:00:00.000","description":"Build modern websites with Jaspr and Bulma CSS.

It is represented as a client-side object that authenticates the client when they are accessing server functions.\n\n![None](/blogs/2024-05-17-coffee-code-nakama-secure-sessions/1_gRzRDHeSPoa-FQac6ZMpqw.gif)\n\nThis implementation provides a significantly more secure way for users to interact with server functions, thereby improving overall app security.\n\n```dart\n// Decode the session token.\nfinal res = JwtDecoder.decode(session.token);\n\n// Return session data from decoded token.\nreturn SessionData(\n  uid: res['uid'],\n  username: res['usn'],\n  email: res['vrs']['email'],\n  expiresAt: DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(res['exp'] * 1000),\n);\n```\n\nThere is more to come on this topic, so stay tuned for more insights and revelations in the near future.","date":"2024-05-17T00:00:00.000","description":"Master Nakama's session system for secure user authentication in game

from [**Cafés De Origin**](https://cafesdeorigen.net/) in El Poblado, Medellín, Colombia.\n> \n\nWhen it comes to building applications, I used to jump right into development.\n\nMinimum understanding, with a lack of structured resources was always a go to for me.\n\nHowever, without having a strict process to follow, I always found myself asking more questions than I should while in the middle of development.\n\n![1_AFzsEc4-VRCDK6OU3NljVQ.gif](/blogs/2024-04-27-coffee-code-miro-user-flows/1_AFzsEc4-VRCDK6OU3NljVQ.gif)\n\n> Miro website.\n> \n\nMaybe because of my eagerness to start coding, (I’m pretty sure that’s it), but I skipped one of the most important steps in development; creating user flows.\n\nA user flow is a user experience (UX) concept that explores and records the actions a typical user must take to complete a specific task.\n\nWith this understanding, it makes the development smoother as you now how a solid reference on what the experience should be from the client’s perspective.\n\n![1_bFxptW--kGEt4GnMA03hvw.gif](/blogs/2024-04-27-coffee-code-miro-user-flows/1_bFxptW--kGEt4GnMA03hvw.gif)\n\n> My example user flow for the project.\n> \n\nThere are several softwares available to create user flows, including [**ClickUp**](https://clickup.com/) and [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/), but I decided to try out [**Miro**](https://miro.com/) because of it’s simplicity and recommendation from other developers.\n\nI am preparing to work on a web app for a local coffee shop and felt it was the opportune time to develop this app the right way.\n\nThis is my simple user flow as of now, with navigation between pages and actions when clicking buttons.\n\n![1_q7kz1cC_AhpBOuhJogplvw.gif](/blogs/2024-04-27-coffee-code-miro-user-flows/1_q7kz1cC_AhpBOuhJogplvw.gif)\n\n>

usual.\n\n![None](/blogs/2024-04-01-coffee-code-firestore-sorting-toasts/1_qHzMtGyw5RzZ7p3VNjQU8w.jpg)\n\nSome features I've been working on this sprint is the ability to sort the books and display toasts messages.\n\n![Video Demo](/blogs/2024-04-01-coffee-code-firestore-sorting-toasts/1_tK89gLMm0D5igCzhkezS8g.gif \"Video Demo\")<br/>*Video Demo*\n\nFor sorting, I updated the method for fetching books to accept a string query param and a boolean isDescending param.\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';\nimport 'package:quote_keeper/data/services/book_service.dart';\nimport 'package:quote_keeper/domain/models/book_model.dart';\nimport 'package:quote_keeper/utils/config/providers.dart';\n\n/// Fetch the next list of books using \nvoid getNextBooks() async {\n  try {\n    state = const AsyncLoading();\n\n    // Order by term, i.e. name, author, title, etc.\n    final orderBy = ref.read(Providers.bookSearchTermProvider).query;\n\n    // Is the list descending or not.\n    final descending = ref.read(Providers.bookSearchIsDescendingProvider);\n\n    // Return the quotes for this user.    \n    final uid = ref.read(Providers.authAsyncProvider.notifier).getUid();\n\n    final querySnapshot = await _bookService.getBooks(\n      orderBy: orderBy,\n      descending: descending,\n      uid: uid,\n\n      // Previous firestore document used for pagination.\n      lastDocument: _lastDocument,\n\n      // Number of results to fetch with each query.=\n      limit: 10,\n    );\n\n    _lastDocument = querySnapshot.docs.last;\n\n    List<BookModel> books = _convertQuerySnapshotToBooks(querySnapshot);\n\n    state = AsyncData([...state.value!, ...books]);\n } catch (e) {}\n```\n\nThe BookSearchIsDescendingNotifier returns true/false if the list should be descending.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';\n\n/// Holds the value of whether the search results are descending or not.\nclass BookSearchIsDescendingNotifier extends AutoDisposeNotifier<bool> {\n  \n  /// Default isDescending to true.\n  @override\n  bool build() => true;\n\n  /// Update to the inverse of its current value.\n  void toggle() => state = !state;\n}\n```\n\nThe BookSearchTermNotifier returns the current BookSearchTerm, (name, author, created date, or modified date).\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';\n\n/// Options for sorting a users quotes.\nenum BookSearchTerm {\n  title('Title', 'title'),\n  created('Created', 'created'),\n  modified('Modified', 'modified'),\n  author('Author', 'author');\n  \n  const BookSearchTerm(this.label, this.query);\n\n  final String label;\n  final String query;\n}\n\n/// Holds the current query for searching quotes.\nclass BookSearchTermNotifier extends AutoDisposeNotifier<BookSearchTerm> {\n  // Default the book search to sort by created value.\n  @override\n  BookSearchTerm build() => BookSearchTerm.created;\n\n  // Update the book search term enum value.\n  void updateTerm(BookSearchTerm term) => state = term;\n}\n```\n\nFor displaying modal toasts, which are temporary messages displayed in the UI, I incorporated the [Toastification](https://pub.dev/packages/toastification) flutter package.\n\n![Updating username.](/blogs/2024-04-01-coffee-code-firestore-sorting-toasts/1_6mQtovDuGqpKUBVGr5sOcQ.gif \"Updating username.\")<br/>*Updating username.*\n\nIt is a very lightweight and flexible package for making use of toast messages.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:quote_keeper/utils/constants/toast_type.dart';\nimport 'package:toastification/toastification.dart';\n\nclass ModalService {\n  /// Displays a toast message.\n  /// Takes in a required context and message.\n  /// The toastType modifies ui icons and
