I started a simple side project the other day.

While reading books, I like to take notes of some of my favorite quotes throughout the reading.

Typically to view my favorite quote, I would need to open up the book again and look for my highlighted text.

However, I thought the process could be easier if a Flutter app could be used to store all the books I’ve read as well as the best quote.

In the app, I upload meta data related to the book, then on the dashboard, my favorite quotes are randomly displayed.

Making apps that are truly effective in everyday life is the mantra.
